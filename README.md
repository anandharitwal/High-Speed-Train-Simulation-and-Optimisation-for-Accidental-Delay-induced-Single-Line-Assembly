# High-Speed-Train-Simulation-and-Optimisation-for-Accidental-Delay-induced-Single-Line-Assembly
Train simulation between London and Birmingham station. The model simulates n number of trains with K number of blocks to safely drive train given maximum speed of 86.1 m/s, while max acceleration of 0.76 m/s2 and safely decelerating at 0.38 m/s2. There is a five second delay after a train passes a signal before it changes back to green. The model is further optimised to maximum number of trains per hour given an accidental delay of half hour introduced at 9.00 am to 9.30 am. The report yields that maximum 20 trains per hour can transit given the number of blocks is 2 to maximise the transport. Three methods of optimisation were used namely random hill climbing, Greedy hill climbing and Monte-Carlo simulation. Monte-Carlo gave the best result for optimisation on all three
